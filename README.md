DeStrategy White Paper (Detailed Version)

1. Project Overview

DeStrategy is a blockchain-based tokenized stock collateral lending platform.
Its goal is to provide retail investors with institutional-grade “strategic” asset management and leverage investment tools similar to those used by companies like MicroStrategy.
Users can tokenize blue-chip stocks (e.g., Tesla, Nvidia), deposit them as collateral, and borrow stablecoins to invest in and allocate crypto assets, achieving efficient capital flow and growth.

Unlike traditional institutions, DeStrategy uses smart contracts to automatically execute lending and risk control, enabling ordinary investors to participate in complex leveraged asset strategies with a low entry barrier.

2. Market Background & Opportunity

2.1 Gap in Institutional-Grade Asset Strategies

In traditional capital markets, MicroStrategy raised funds through bonds and stock issuance to purchase Bitcoin, achieving significant capital appreciation.
Such strategies are typically available only to large institutions due to high capital thresholds and strict compliance requirements—retail investors cannot directly replicate them.
The market lacks safe, compliant strategic lending products for retail users, leaving a huge gap.

2.2 Stablecoin Regulation—Challenges & Opportunities

Recently, the U.S. and other countries have tightened stablecoin regulations, requiring them to be backed by sufficient reserves in treasuries or fiat currency.
Pure algorithmic stablecoins, lacking physical asset collateral, face high compliance and credit risk.
Tokenized stocks offer a new compliant form of collateral for stablecoin and lending products, providing an innovative solution.

2.3 Rapid Growth of the Tokenized Stock Market

Securities tokenization technology is maturing—platforms like Ondo have already launched multiple blue-chip stock tokens (TSLA-Token, NVDA-Token, etc.).
Tokenized stocks remove the liquidity restrictions of traditional stocks, allowing them to be pledged, lent, and traded directly on-chain.
DeStrategy integrates Ondo’s API to sync real-time prices and data, ensuring lending accuracy and fairness.

2.4 Potential for DeFi–Traditional Asset Integration

The DeFi lending market continues to grow rapidly, with increasing demand for diversified, low-volatility collateral assets.
Blue-chip stock tokens provide high-quality, stable collateral for lending protocols.
By combining the stability of traditional assets with the liquidity and automation of DeFi, DeStrategy aims to become a crucial bridge between traditional finance and digital assets.

3. Core Value & Positioning

3.1 Democratizing Institutional Strategies

Through smart contracts, DeStrategy automates stock-token collateralization, stablecoin lending, and asset allocation strategies, lowering the entry threshold for retail users.
Users can, like MicroStrategy, use stock asset leverage to buy crypto and diversify their portfolios.

3.2 Partnership Ecosystem & Asset Security

By partnering with reputable stock-token issuers such as Ondo, the platform ensures underlying assets are legally compliant and data is accurate in real time.
The system employs multi-layer risk control mechanisms to safeguard user assets.

3.3 Risk Management & Multi-Layer Protection

Strict loan-to-value (LTV) ratios prevent over-leveraging and liquidation risks.
A progressive liquidation mechanism avoids sudden mass sell-offs that could crash prices.
An insurance pool will be introduced to protect against extreme market volatility.

3.4 Incentive System & Governance

Currently, a points-based incentive system rewards lending and deposits.
Points will correspond to future governance token allocation.
Governance tokens will be used for protocol governance and the insurance pool, enhancing sustainability.

4. Product Architecture

4.1 Tokenized Stock Module

Using APIs from partners like Ondo, blue-chip stocks (TSLA, NVDA, etc.) are tokenized on-chain.
Token prices update in real time to ensure transparent lending and liquidation.
Users can manage stock-token assets directly via the platform dashboard.

4.2 Lending Protocol Module

Users deposit stock tokens into the protocol as collateral, receiving cTokens to represent their lending shares.
They can borrow a proportion of stablecoins (USDC, USDT) based on collateral value.
Interest rates adjust dynamically according to market supply and demand.
Progressive partial liquidation reduces market impact.
The protocol will include an insurance pool to cover extreme liquidation risks (future feature).

4.3 Asset Allocation Module

Borrowed stablecoins can be used to purchase mainstream crypto assets (BTC, ETH) or join in-protocol yield strategies.
Supports auto-compounding and risk-adjusted allocation to maximize capital efficiency.

4.4 Incentives & Governance Module

Currently rewards users with points for deposits and borrowing.
Points are tied to future governance token issuance, encouraging long-term participation.
Governance token holders will help make protocol decisions and manage risk.
Future governance tokens will also be allocated to the insurance pool.

4.5 Protocol Architecture Design

The lending protocol follows the mature Compound V2 design for stability and security.
dcTokens represent user collateral shares for efficient management and liquidation.
Interest rates are based on utilization rate, automatically adjusting lending costs.
Progressive liquidation prevents price crashes from mass sell-offs.
The insurance pool acts as a risk buffer for extreme market conditions.

5. Risk Management Strategy
	•	Conservative LTV settings ensure collateral safety during volatility.
	•	Progressive liquidation reduces market shocks from forced selling.
	•	Insurance pool provides a safeguard against systemic and extreme market risks.
	•	Multi-asset collateral spreads risk.
	•	KYC and credit checks reduce malicious activity.

6. Economic Model Design

6.1 Points Incentive Mechanism
	•	Users earn points for deposits and borrowing.
	•	Points are tied to future governance token issuance.
	•	Simple and transparent system for easy participation.

6.2 Governance Token Roadmap
	•	Governance token (DST) to be issued after protocol maturity.
	•	Tokens used for governance, incentives, and insurance pool building.
	•	Holders can vote on parameters, risk management, and revenue distribution.
	•	Vesting and linear release mechanisms to prevent speculation.

6.3 Interest Rate Model
	•	Rates adjust dynamically based on utilization.
	•	Low utilization → low rates to encourage borrowing.
	•	High utilization → higher rates to control risk.
	•	Deposit rate = borrowing rate minus protocol spread.

6.4 Buyback & Burn Mechanism (Future)
	•	Part of protocol revenue used to buy back governance tokens.
	•	Burned to reduce supply and increase value.
	•	Supports a sustainable economic system.

Flywheel Model & Marketing Point

The ultimate goal is a “Crypto–Stock Hybrid Flywheel Leverage Model”:

Layer 1: Off-Chain (Traditional Financing)
	•	Pledge stocks to banks/brokers → receive fiat or credit lines.
	•	Use fiat to buy crypto (BTC, ETH, etc.) directly.
	•	Or convert fiat to stablecoins via OTC/exchanges for on-chain use.
	•	Similar to issuing bonds or stock-collateralized loans (MicroStrategy model).

Layer 2: On-Chain (Tokenized Stocks + DeFi Lending)
	•	Tokenize company-owned stocks (TSLA-Token, NVDA-Token).
	•	Deposit them into DeStrategy Lending Protocol (Compound-like cToken model).
	•	Borrow stablecoins (USDC/USDT).
	•	Use borrowed stablecoins to buy crypto (BTC, ETH, or native protocol tokens).
	•	Crypto yield or appreciation → distributed to stockholders or LPs as “on-chain dividends.”
	•	If yield > borrowing cost → flywheel accelerates.

Layer 3: Flywheel Structure (“Crypto–Stock Asset Company” Model)
	•	Tokenize company-owned stock via Ondo (BMNR, SBET).
	•	Deposit into DeStrategy as collateral.
	•	Borrow USDC → buy crypto.
	•	Crypto appreciation + partial sales → pay high yields / “on-chain dividends.”
	•	High yields attract more USDC deposits → deeper lending pool.
	•	More liquidity → more borrowing → more crypto buying → cycle repeats.

Revenue Sources:
	•	Crypto capital gains.
	•	Interest spread (borrow rate – deposit rate).
	•	Management/transaction fees.

Risks:
	•	Stock price drop → collateral devaluation → liquidation (on/off-chain).
	•	Crypto price drop → leveraged losses.
	•	Liquidity risk (large withdrawals from lending pool).
	•	Regulatory risk (tokenized stocks require approval in many jurisdictions).

Summary:
This can theoretically become a “On-Chain MicroStrategy Model”:
	•	Bring listed company stock assets on-chain.
	•	Loop lending to buy crypto.
	•	Use crypto yields to pay dividend-like interest.
However, liquidation must be extremely robust to handle dual volatility in stocks & crypto—may require market makers’ involvement.
